# Hover Chrome Extension

## Building
To build the extension, first make sure you have all the dependencies:
  * `node`
  * `browserify`
  * `uglify-js`

Run the build script `./build-extension` to compile the extension. The resulting output file will be found in the `hover-extension` folder, which can then be loaded into Chrome in **Developer Mode** via `chrome://extensions`.
