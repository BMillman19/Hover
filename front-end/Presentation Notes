Slide 1:

- The future is moving towards touchless sensing. 
- With products like the myo gesture control armband and leap motion controller, we're exploring endless boundaries
- But these all require new hardware - which takes both time and money, especially when it comes to us developers learning how to develop on it 
- Wouldn't it be easier if we could simply use the hardware we already have?
- Take my iPhone for example, wouldn't it be cool if while I'm giving a presentation I could just swipe my hand over the phone and have it control the slides?
